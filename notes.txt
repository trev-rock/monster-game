the names of a lot of these things would be changed
all numerical values are subject to change


a psychic poison type that is clown like inspired by hisoka and it cna do something like bungee gum


after an attack is chosen then it goes into the calculator with all its stats, that is also when it rolls for crit

i want moves to have different things to it
attack/special attack damage number, one or two elemental types that have even more precise multipliers because the moves will be more intricate this also means that stab can be double too, affinities go with moves as well to have an additional multiplier that matches the multipliers of effieincy of nen in this they will be called class types eventually, weather boosts, 

make sure moves have class affinity

sumoning snakes that can blast energy and stuff from your arms go on reddi and find someone knowledgeable about nen




new notes on the two calculators 7/25
calculator 1 will work exactly like pokemons, this will only be for basic elemental attacks 
calculator 2 will be built further on the current calculator from first_conept.py, some things i want to have on that calculator, the nen affinities will also be a multiplier for damage, terrain multiplier, dual elemental types for attacks
regular passives and class passives

accuracy, side effects need to be added 
taking super effective damage and the multipliers need to be added in, the class based dmg calculator will have even more exact/exaggerated values because moves can be double stab if the user is a dual type
class based abilities use aura as a resource
